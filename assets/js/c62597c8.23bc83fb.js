Their actions have thwarted the first joint attempt by the KMT and the TPP to undermine Taiwan\'s democratic system. According to Chung-chiang Lai, Convener of the Economic Democracy Union: "We are autonomous citizens of Taiwan. We are not here due to the call from any political party, nor will we leave because of the persuasion by any political party."\nThis gathering marks the fourth mass assembly during consecutive plenary session in the Legislative Yuan, setting a record in the history of Taiwan\u2019s social movements. We must remain resolute because we understand that if Taiwanese civil society shows any sign of weakness, the caucus led by Fu Kun-Chi will definitely take advantage. Beyond the three key legislative bills, there are also concerns about the Hualien-Taitung financial pitfall bill, the NCC regulations, the extension of the nuclear power plant operation, and potential amendments to the same-sex marriage law, pension reforms, the Anti-Infiltration Act, and the five law on National Security.\nWe must firmly tell the Fu Kun-Chi group that the strength of Taiwanese citizens will not allow any regression in democracy. The Legislative Yuan must uphold the spirit of collegiality to ensure that the opinions of minority parties can be considered and discussed while the views of the majority party can be thoroughly and reasonably examined. We absolutely will not allow the new norm in our democratic parliament to be defined by the majority violence using the tactics of \u201cshutting down proposals\u201d, \u201cretaining entire bills\u201d, or \u201cstopping discussions in three minutes\u201d, as seen in the monopoly scheme displayed by the Blue-White Coalition.\nChung-chiang Lai, Convenor of the Economic Democracy Union, also expressed the goodwill of civil society groups and urged both the KMT and the TPP to suspend the legislative preceding of the highly controversial amendment of "Contempt of Congress" of the Criminal Code.

He also highlighted the need to avoid malicious attacks and to work towards achieving consensus.\nLirong (Lily) Chiang, Executive Director of the Taipei Shining Sisters Alliance, stated that the politicians of both the Blue and White camps are using violent and chaotic tactics to push the bills through, driven by their apprehension of opposition from their colleagues in the same party who still have some conscience.
