The organizers urged people nationwide to embrace grassroots democratic spirit, actively participate, and apply pressure to overstepping legislators. Following a press conference, over 10,000 people rolled the giant balls inscribed with "Citizens Defend Democracy, Restart Social Dialogue" into the Legislative Yuan, symbolically bringing the voice of the people to the legislature.

For instance, the mandate for interpellation following the State of the Union clearly breaches constitutional provisions. Article 25 of the Law Governing Legislative Yuan\u2019s Powers grants legislators extensive interpellation authority, enabling them to demand officials as well as private citizens to provide information. This is at odds with the principle that investigative authority should be exercised collectively by the entire Legislative Yuan plenary session.

This effort aims to shed light on the details of parliamentary power abuse bills and the adverse effects on the separation of powers and Taiwan\'s democracy. CSOs will develop training materials for dummies, and offer training sessions for debriefers to help the public thoroughly understand the implications of the bills.
