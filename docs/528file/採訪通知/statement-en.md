In the last three plenary sessions on May 17th, 21st, and 24th, there has been steady increase of the crowd protesting outside the Legislative Yuan to stop the swift passage of the bills of the abuse of congressional powers by the KMT and the TPP. The rallies have demonstrated the unwavering resilience and determination of Taiwanese citizens. Moreover, there have been people assembling in cities nationwide to express their opposition to the Bills, showing the people's commitment to democracy and their will to take action in safeguarding Taiwan.

However, both the KMT and the TPP still plan to push the bills through the third reading by tomorrow (28th). Over fifty co-hosting organizations, including the Taiwan Citizens Front, Economic Democracy Union, and Referendum Alliance to Protect Taiwan, are urging citizens from across the nation to actively oversee the proceedings, voice their disapproval and outrage, and collaboratively discuss the future actions.

At this press conference, the Taiwan Economic Democracy Union will release a statement appealing to legislators and invite the public to join the discussion on the implications and impact of these power abuse bills on Taiwan’s democracy and human rights.
