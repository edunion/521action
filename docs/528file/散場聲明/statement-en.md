# From Assembly at Legislative Yuan to Local Dialogue 
## CSOs launch nationwide campaigns to caution against power-abuse legislators.
In the evening of May 28th, CSOs displayed the slogan on the exterior of the Legislative Yuan, "Stop Congressional Power Abuse, Reject China Interference” with an image of Blue Bird symbolizing freedom and hope. Lai Chung-Chiang, the convener of the Economic Democracy Union stated that this people’s assembly not only raised the public awareness about abuse of congressional powers but also successfully challenged the Fu Kun-chi faction with a clear and firm message that the public oppose secret legislation becoming the new norm in the legislature. Lai also called on citizens across Taiwan to take proactive measures to caution those lawmakers abusing their power.

Lai expressed disappointment that the KMT and the TPP not only ignored the CSOs’ call to halt proceedings this morning but kept pushing through the third reading of the Contempt of Congress provisions in the Criminal Code.

The CSOs announced six counter measures at the earlier press conference. Though the rally could not stop the power-abuse bill from passage at this time, the action still carried important meanings as the following:

1. Emphasizing the Risks of Power Abuse Legislation: Through four sessions at the Legislative Yuan and ongoing advocacy, citizens all over the nation have gained a clearer understanding about the power-abuse bills and the threat to a democratic system and the rights of people.

2. The Rise of People’s Power: This action highlighted the strength of civil society. Over the next four years, Taiwan's civil society will serve as an independent force monitoring the three major political parties in the Legislature and the Lai administration, the fifth force of civic society will continue proactive engagement in public affairs.

3. Eye-Opening Lesson for Power-Abuse Lawmakers: Legislators must understand that an opaque lawmaking process cannot become a new norm in parliament. The people of Taiwan are watching their every move.

4. Uncovering China's Political Interference: Our investigation has shown that China's United Front task force has influenced the local network of KMT via Fu Kun-Chi, the majority whip. They collaborated with TPP’s Huang Guochang to gain control over the KMT and the TPP, aiming to destabilize the democratic mechanism with a parliamentary majority.

Before the end of today’s rally, Lai emphasized that the next action will focus on local dialogue. People’s power will reconvene to safeguard democracy. We will continue monitoring the administration and the legislature to ensure that the rights of the people are fully protected.

Lai Chung-Chiang concluded by underscoring the significance of the China factor throughout the whole legislative preceding this time, stressing the need to strengthen our democratic defense mechanism against external threats. Civil society organizations will collaborate with the organizers of the upcoming June Fourth commemoration to emphasize the importance of defending democracy and urge everyone to work together in safeguarding Taiwan's freedom and democracy.

More than 70,000 people gathered outside the Legislative Yuan in the evening of May 28 and they collectively pushed large balls symbolizing public opinion with the slogan of "Stop Congressional Power Abuse" and "Reject China Interference” into the Legislature. The CSOs onsite expressed their deep gratitude to the people participating in the action and invited everyone to continue working together to safeguard Taiwan's democratic values.
